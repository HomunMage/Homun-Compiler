# Homun-Compiler
make homun to research about how to write compiler

Homun-Lang: homunc compiler that will compile .hom lang to .rs then compile by rs.

mermaid-ascii: compile mermaid to ascii art or svg, py ver and rust ver.

Target: use .hom + .rs to place py ver mermaid-ascii and remove rs ver, py ver to proove .hom is as easy as py of sugar canddy of rs.

Better Design is that we extend Homun-Lang/runtime/**.rs to make this job
